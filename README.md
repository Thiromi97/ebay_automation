This repository contains a fun and exciting test automation project for buying a mobile phone from eBay.com using Selenium WebDriver with Java. Let's automate like a boss! 💪

## Project Overview 👁️‍🗨️

The main goal of this project is to magically automate the entire process of purchasing a shiny new mobile phone from eBay.com. Our automation sorcery includes:

🔍 Searching for mobile phones in the "Cell Phones & Accessories" category.
🎯 Filtering search results by selecting a specific brand (e.g., Apple).
📱 Choosing the first search result - the chosen one! ✨
💡 Extracting and verifying product details like name, price, quantity, and condition.
🛒 Adding the product to the cart and comparing it with the product details - poof! It's there! 🎉

## Project Structure 🏗️

The magical code is structured into four enchanted classes:

1. **`ebayTest`**: The master class that sets up the WebDriver, opens the browser, and executes test cases like a wizard using TestNG annotations. 🧙‍♂️

2. **`HomePage`**: The mystical class representing the eBay.com homepage. It conjures methods to interact with homepage elements, such as searching for mobile phones and selecting the "Cell Phones & Accessories" category. 🧞‍♂️

3. **`SearchResultPage`**: The enigmatic class embodying the search result page. It weaves methods to filter results with magical brand selection and choose the first search result - all in one wave of the wand! 🧙‍♀️

4. **`ProductPage`**: The arcane class holding the secrets of product page details. It reveals the item name, price, quantity, and condition, as if by magic. And, with a wave and a flick, adds the product to the cart! 🪄

## How to Run the Magic ✨

To experience the magical tests yourself, follow these enchanted steps:

🧙‍♂️ Clone this repository to your local machine - don't forget the magic word!
🧙‍♀️ Open the project in your favorite spellbook - ahem, I mean IntelliJ IDE.
🧙‍♂️ Make sure you've conjured the necessary dependencies mentioned in the `pom.xml` file (Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and other magic spells).
🧙‍♀️ Feel free to modify the TestNG XML file (`testing.xml`) to invoke different browsers (Chrome, Edge) and their respective URLs.
🧙‍♂️ With a grand flourish, right-click on the TestNG XML file and select "Run 'testing.xml'" to unleash the magic of test execution! 🌟
